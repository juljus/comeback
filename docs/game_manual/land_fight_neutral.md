# Fighting for Neutral Land

When you land on a neutral (unclaimed) land, you can choose to **buy** it or **attack** to capture it.

## Attack Attempts

You get **up to 3 attack attempts** to defeat the land's defender:

| Action Points Remaining | Attack Attempts |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| 3 (morning) | 3 attempts |
| 2 (noon) | 2 attempts |
| 1 (evening) | 1 attempt |

**Each attack attempt costs 1 action point.**

If you did anything before attacking (buy item, cast spell, etc.), you have fewer attempts remaining.

## Victory and Defeat

- **Success:** Kill the defender within your attempts → you capture the land
- **Failure:** Defender survives all attempts → night arrives, battle ends, you do NOT get the land

## Example Scenarios

**Full day attack:**
- Morning: Attack defender (1 AP) - defender survives
- Noon: Attack again (1 AP) - defender survives
- Evening: Attack again (1 AP) - defender dies → land captured

**After buying an item:**
- Morning: Buy item (1 AP)
- Noon: Attack defender (1 AP) - defender survives
- Evening: Attack again (1 AP) - defender survives → night, battle ends, no land

## Default Defenders

Each land type has a default defender (tier 1). See [Land Types](land_types.md) for the full list.

Examples of tier 1 defenders:
- Valley: Pikeman
- Forest: Wolf
- Highland: Barbarian
- Hill: Orc
- Mountain: Dwarf

## Strategic Considerations

From the help file:

> "Whenever you land on neutral land and such a choice arises, consider: how many HP you have, how hard you hit, or if you know some spells and if the required mana is available; and of course - who is defending."

**Damage estimation example:**
- Starting damage: 1d5 (average 3 per hit)
- Kobold has 9 HP → likely defeatable in 3 hits
- Barbarian has 15 HP → very unlikely in 3 hits (like rolling 5 three times in a row)

## Buying vs Attacking

"Buy Land" requires:
- Full day (morning only, no prior actions)
- Sufficient gold

Attacking requires:
- At least 1 action point remaining
- Enough strength to defeat the defender
