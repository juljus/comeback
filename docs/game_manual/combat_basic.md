# Basic Combat

## Land Capture Combat

When attacking a neutral land to capture it:

### Attack Attempts
- You get **up to 3 attack attempts** per turn (morning, noon, evening)
- **Each attack attempt costs 1 action point**
- If you used action points before attacking, you have fewer attempts remaining
- You must **defeat the defender within your remaining attempts**

### Outcome
- **Success:** Defender defeated → you capture the land
- **Failure:** Defender survives all attempts → night arrives, battle ends, you do NOT get the land

### Example
- Morning: Attack defender (1 action point) - defender survives
- Noon: Attack again (1 action point) - defender survives
- Evening: Attack again (1 action point) - defender dies → land captured

Or if you bought an item first:
- Morning: Buy item (1 action point)
- Noon: Attack defender (1 action point) - defender survives
- Evening: Attack again (1 action point) - defender survives → night, battle ends, no land

## Attack Resolution

Each attack attempt:
1. Roll damage: sum of d1 rolls of d2-sided dice
2. Apply armor reduction (unless pierce critical)
3. Check for critical effects (bleed, stun based on weapon type)
4. Apply elemental damage if weapon has it
5. Check if defender dies

## Combat vs Other Players

When landing on enemy-owned land:
- Combat is automatic
- Land defenders fight alongside the owner
- Similar action point mechanics apply

## Adjacent Land Reinforcement

From help file: If you own adjacent lands, their defenders can come to help:
- Reinforcement arrives on the **next round** (next action point)
- If you defeat the defender in one attack, reinforcements don't arrive
