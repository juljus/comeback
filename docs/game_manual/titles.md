# Titles

Titles are ranks granted to players who accumulate enough lands.

## Title System

> "Title is received when a player has collected a certain number of lands."
> — Help file, line 110

> "There are three titles. Baron - 3 lands, Count - 9 lands, Duke - 15 lands."
> — Help file, line 111

### Title Thresholds

| Title | Lands Required |
|-------|----------------|
| None | 0–2 |
| Baron | 3+ |
| Count | 9+ |
| Duke | 15+ |

## Title Benefits

Titles provide two main benefits:

### 1. King's Salary

Each title grants a gold salary when passing through Royal Court:

| Title | Salary |
|-------|--------|
| None | 20 gold |
| Baron | Configurable (default varies) |
| Count | Configurable (default varies) |
| Duke | Configurable (default varies) |

### 2. Mercenary Access

> "The higher the player's title, the more creatures are willing to serve the player."
> — Help file, line 37

Higher titles unlock access to stronger mercenaries at the Mercenary Camp. See [Mercenaries](mercenaries.md) for details on title bonuses.

## King's Gift

> "King's gift. Each title comes with a gift from the king. Actually it's a choice between three different things. Choose carefully, it can make a big difference in the game."
> — Help file, line 109

When you earn a new title, you receive a **King's Gift** — a choice of three items. The value of items offered scales with your title:

| Title | Item Value Range |
|-------|------------------|
| Baron | 50–120 gold |
| Count | 121–300 gold |
| Duke | 301–1000 gold |

**Important:** Each title's gift can only be received once. Losing and regaining lands does not grant additional gifts.

---

## Title Progression

Titles are automatically checked whenever your land count changes:
- Gaining a land may promote you to a higher title
- Losing lands does **not** demote your title

Once earned, a title is permanent for the game.

## Title Names

Titles have gender-specific names:

| Rank | Male | Female |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Baron | Baroness |
| 2 | Count | Countess |
| 3 | Duke | Duchess |
